            DIRECTIONS
 
In a kadai or wok over medium heat, warm the oil. Add onions and garlic and sauté until onion is translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili powder. Sauté for a minute or so. If you notice the spices sticking to the bottom of the pan, sprinkle in a little bit of water.
Stir in ginger, garam masala, and salt and sauté for about 30 seconds. Fold in chicken, cook for 1 minute, then add tomato sauce and ketchup, stirring to combine well. Cook, covered, over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add dried fenugreek leaves and continue cooking, covered, until chicken is fully cooked, 10 to 12 minutes.
☞TESTER TIP: If the sauce seems too thick while cooking, drizzle in a tablespoon or two of water to thin it out.

Gently mix in heavy cream until well distributed. Simmer for 1 minute, then remove from heat. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more chili powder or salt, if desired.
Garnish with a pat of butter and cilantro leaves. Serve warm.
