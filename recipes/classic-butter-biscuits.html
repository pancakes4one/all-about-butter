            <h1>Classic Butter Biscuits</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the work surface</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold</li>
                <li>1 cup buttermilk, cold</li>
            </ul>
            INSTRUCTIONS
            PREP: Position an oven rack to the center position and preheat to 450°F/230°C. Spray a
            cast iron pan (or cake pan) with non-stick spray or line a sheet pan with parchment paper
            or a silicone baking mat. Measure out all ingredients. Dice the butter into small cubes.
            Keep the butter and buttermilk in the refrigerator until ready to use.
            TO MAKE THE BISCUITS:
            In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add
            the cold diced butter to the mixing bowl and cut it into the flour mixture. To do this,
            press down on the fat with the wires of the pastry blender or the tines of a fork as you
            move it around the bowl. Continue cutting the fat into the flour until most of the pieces
            of fat are about the size of peas with some pieces being about the size of a walnut half. Add
            the cold buttermilk into the bowl and stir with a spoon or a silicone spatula just until
            combined. This should only take a few turns. The dough will be pretty wet and sticky. Turn
            the dough out onto a lightly floured counter. Dust flour over the top of the dough. With
            floured hands bring the dough together into one mass. Pat the dough out (do not roll
            with a rolling pin) until it is about 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick. Using a bench knife (or a metal
            spatula can be helpful if you do not have a bench knife), fold the dough in half and then
            turn it 90 degrees. Pat out and fold again for a total of 6 times. This process is creating
            layers that will create flaky biscuits. Press the dough out to about 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick
            and use a round cutter that is about 2.5-inches (6 cm) in diameter to cut out your biscuits.
            When cutting out, dip your cutter in flour, press straight down, and pull it back up without
            twisting it. Twisting can seal the edge of your biscuit, not allowing it to rise fully. 
            Gently pat the scraps together to cut out the rest of your biscuits. Alternatively, 
            you can pat the dough into a rectangle and use a sharp knife to divide the dough into 
            8 rectangular-shaped biscuits. Place the biscuits in the prepared cast iron pan or baking
            sheet with the edges touching so they will rise up against each other. As an optional step,
            place the pan in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. This will ensure that your
            biscuits will not spread too much and will allow your oven to fully pre-heat. Bake at 450°F
            for 13-15 minutes until golden brown. Do not open the oven door for at least the first half
            of baking time. You want the steam to stay trapped in the oven to help with the rise. 
            Optional: Brush biscuits with melted butter and sprinkle with flaky salt.
