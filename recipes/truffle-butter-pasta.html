            <h1>Truffle Butter Pasta</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon good olive oil</li>
                <li>12 ounces cremini mushrooms, stems removed, caps sliced 1/4-inch thick</li>
                <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>3 ounces white truffle butter</li>
                <li>8.82 ounces fresh fettuccine</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, plus extra for garnish</li>
                <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus extra for garnish</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Add 1 tablespoon of salt to a large pot of water and bring it to a boil.
            Meanwhile, melt the butter and olive oil in a large (12-inch) saute pan over
            medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, tossing often,
            until the mushrooms are cooked and the liquid has evaporated. Transfer the
            mushrooms to a bowl and rinse out the pan. Pour the cream into the saute pan
            and heat it over medium heat until it simmers. Add the truffle butter, 1 teaspoon
            salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, lower the heat to very low and swirl the butter until
            it melts. Keep warm over very low heat. Meanwhile, add the pasta to the boiling
            water and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Drain the pasta in a colander and add it to
            the truffle cream. Add the chives and mushrooms and toss well with tongs. Stir
            in the Parmesan. Serve hot in shallow bowls, garnished with extra chives and Parmesan.</p>
